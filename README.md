# Diabetes-Prediction
This project leverages the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes or not, using the Diabetes dataset. It covers data preprocessing, model building, evaluation using Python.

📁 Dataset
Source: Kaggle - Pima Indians Diabetes Database
File Used: diabetes.csv
The dataset includes 768 samples with 8 features and a binary target (Outcome):
Features: Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age
Target: Outcome (0 = No diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)

🔧 Technologies Used
Python
Jupyter Notebook
NumPy, Pandas
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Scikit-learn (SVM, train_test_split, metrics)

📈 Results
The SVM model achieved an accuracy of 78% on the test dataset.
The SVM model achieved an accuracy of 77.2% on the train dataset.

📌 Objective
The goal of this project is to build a simple and interpretable machine learning model to aid in the early detection of diabetes. SVM is chosen due to its robustness and effectiveness in binary classification problems.
